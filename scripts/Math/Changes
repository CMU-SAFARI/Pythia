	Prototypes added (121 not ok, 127 skipped);
	gdivround, ifact added (122 not ok, 112 skipped);
	Documentation brushed up;
	Quickier switch inside loadPari;

	matrix() could have been called with the same variable for two
		iterators (4 not ok/30 skip, but segfaults on exit)
	T: move failing tests to will_fail.t;

after 0.8:
	Hi-resolution plotting works if one has Term::Gnuplot v. 0.4,
		one needs to call link_gnuplot() before doing this;
	foncpari.pl now suggests the code for a missing interface (in simplest
		cases);
	interfaces for most functions added (except buch*, string and addhelp);
	indirect variables (like PARIvar('x')) can be indexed like $x->[2];
	T: Interactive plotting test added (ignored if no Term::Gnuplot);
	Bug in libPARI/plotport.c corrected;
	Minor changes to chap3_to_pod;
after 0.91:
	Chip recognition code from PARI2.0alpha0 added;
	Builds on Solaris, gives illegal instruction trap in t/Testout.t:32;
after 0.92:
	Fix the failure on Solaris via aliasing shifts() to pari_shifts()
	(was dynalinking with libnls instead).
after 0.93:
	Updated for newer Term::Gnuplot.

after 0.94:
	Updated for v 2.0.11-beta of PARI.
	One needs to manually copy paricfg.h from pari distribution
		to libPARI directory.
	Processor recognition is on level of 2.0.5-alpha.
	sparcs on linux/nextstep not supported.
	hppa cannot build dynamically, use machine=port instead in
		Makefile.PL line.
after 0.95_00:
	Approximately half of subtests are passed now (229 skip, 337 fail
		out of 782).
	Some more patches to PARI are required (in ./patches).
	Still needs to be built as a subdirectory of the root of PARI tree.
after 0.95_01:
	Tests and paricfg.h are autocopied (but paricfg.h should be
	created first by toplevel configure script!).
	Skip compatibility tests.
	Circa 80% of non-skipped tests is OK (110 fail, 764 skipped
		out of 1381).
	Look for PARI build directory nearby.
	Autogenerate libPARI.pod.
after 0.95_02:
	Tag :prec=digits allowed.
	Overloaded << and >> (in Perl, not XS).
	Hex and octal conversion on _hex_cvt.
	Untested overloaded constants, on :int, :float, :hex import tags.
	Output of doubles explained.
	Flexible interface implemented (with runtime-parsing of
		signature, will not work if sizeof's char*, GEN, long 
		are different.)
		85% pass (366 skipped, 146 fail out of 1381).
			(nfields: some actually-wrong answers?)
after 0.95_03:
	Prototype for flexible-interface functions was wrong.
	Only type()/sumalt()/prodinf()/plot*() are special-cased in
		tests now (in addition to what was in 1.39).
	Better massage of matrix output, use RE to process pari output.
	undef allowed as a value of an optional argument.
	Minor massage of codes to move 'l' and 'v' forward.
	setseriesprecision() implemented.
	sv2pari() was not calling mg_get().

All tests successful, 1 test skipped, plus 156 subtests skipped.
Files=17,  Tests=1393, 204 secs ( 0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 cpu)
		       ^^^ with debugging enabled

after 2.0011_01:
	Build which needed a translation to level0.s, kernel1.s was busted.
	Perl 5.005_52 had conflicting `warner'.
	Perl 5.005_52 has different order of hashes => needed to explicitly
		order the variables in Testout.pm.
	Perl 5.005_52: Autoloading got in the way of FETCHSIZE (implemented)
	:int, :float and :hex import tags tested and fixed.

All tests successful, 1 test skipped, plus 156 subtests skipped.
Files=15,  Tests=1377, 121 wallclock secs ( 0.00 cusr +  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU)

after 2.001102:
        Patching was still busted.
	Use the copy of tar.gz in the current directory if present.

after 2.001103:
        Tests now run with the plotting enabled too.

All tests successful.
Files=15,  Tests=1378, 108 secs (86.46 cusr  3.82 csys = 90.28 cpu)

2.001200:
	new patch for PARI 2.0.12.
	Allow a LF before comma for my_print* tests.
2.001300:
	Special-case version 2.0.13 too (prefer alpha over betas).
	First step to allow dynalinking set_output_file().
2.001301:
	Change interfaces 83 and 84: they are void now.
	Define PERL_POLLUTE.
	During test environment variable MP_NOGNUPLOT may be set to
	not load Term::Gnuplot.
2.001302:
	The hack to fake GEN-as-an-array-reference was creating a
	cyclic reference loop ==> memory leak.
2.001400:
	machine=port target was trying to compile none/level0.s.
	Special-case version 2.0.14 too (prefer alpha over betas).
2.001401:
	machine=port target was trying to compile src//level0.c.
2.001402:
	New patch for issqrt() - was wrong signature.
	Correct backwacking of \s \d.
	Default to `port' for unknow architectures.
	perl -MMath::Pari=:int -e 'for ($i = 1; $i < 10; $i++) {print "$i\n"}'
	     not fixed yet.  (Sometimes segfaults, prints floating points.)
		 (Solution: Make Perl use mymalloc, or upgrade to
		  5.00557 - maybe 5.00505 will also contain the fix.)
2.001403:
	New patch for signatures.
	Die on a wrong import tag, add link_gnuplot() to :graphic.
	Support DV and DI argument declarations, and new code 28 for vector().
	Fix handlers for codes 45 and 49.
	Now keep log of codes as supported by Math::Pari, as
	 implemented by PARI, and have a tool to check this (see libPARI/).
	Make test script creation skip backups and other junk.
2.001500:
	Update assembler-handling logic to 2.0.15-pre level,
	streamline logic a little bit.
	Tested with 2.0.14 and 2.0.15-pre+patches.
2.001501:
	On Linux RedHat 6.0: err was masked by some other dynamic library.
	Make plotting tests work again even without Term::Gnuplot.
	On Linux RedHat 6.0: one subtest of all.t (ellinit) fails, same with
	pure PARI.
	Add autopatches for 2.0.15 (it looks to stay).
2.001600:
	Link with Term::Gnuplot was using a wrong version of link_gnuplot().
	Better reports if run with redirections.
	Updated for 2.0.16.

2.001701:
	Change references to PARI types to t_FOO style.
	Assignment to elements of arrays implemented (probably wasteful).
		   (Can more tests be unskipped?).

2.001702:
	Update for new 'E' key of the interface string.
	Do not consider CVS as a test.

2.001800:
	Support overloaded binary constants, as in 0b1101.
	Support overloaded bitwise operations | & ^ ~ .

2.001801:
	->import() could only be called once due to caching of
	@EXPORT_OK by Exporter.  Thanks to
	thumper@bsi.menlo-park.ca.us for detecting the reason.

2.001802:
	hex() can return a float in newer perls, so overloaded hex
	constants would not work.  Thanks to
	thumper@bsi.menlo-park.ca.us for detecting the reason.

2.001803:
	Exporting the same symbol several times (e.g., to different
	packages) gave spurious warnings.

	Problems to fix yet: ++ floatifies; pari2iv() has a
	32-bit upper bound on 64-bit perls; problems with refcounting
	of array elements and Mod().

2.001804:
	Some declarations needed to be changed for multi-threading compile.

2.010000:
	ploth test was failing, since fake_sizes() was removing a Perl
	array, thus the arithmetic was propagating to double, =>
	problems when PARI sees arguments of a wrong type.
	gphelp updated.
	Remove patches to older version of PARI.
	Fix floatification in $a++ (but the choice of conversion to
	float/int may still be wrong in some cases).

2.010001:
	PARI version would not be calculated correct if Math::Pari is
	in a subdirectory of PARI directory.
	libPARI/gphelp was time-compared with one of PARI, but the
	latter one is autogenerated, thus has a random date.
	int() overloaded if possible.
	Conversion of large PARI's integers to Perl types would not
	croak, but will do as good as it can (should be as in perlnumber.pod).

2.010002:
	On solaris we were aborting if could not find SUNWspro - whose
	libraries we do not use any more!
	Overloading operator for int() had wrong number of parameters;
	In 5.7.1 I needed to change shift to CORE::shift in test_eng/Testout.t.
	New module Math::PariInit.
	New function setprimelimit().

2.010003:
	Math::PariInit would not set $initmem.
	allocatemem() implemented.

2.010004:
	Overloaded << and >> were using Perl's 2 instead of PARI's 2.
	(Need to be rewritten anyway! - but need to add a flag "Behave
	as if module large power of 2" to PARI's shift() first.)
	allocatemem() would not compile on 5.005.

2.010005:
	gcc build on sparc was busted.
	build on 5.00404 was busted.
	Copy pre-cooked Win32's paricfg.h without Configure'ing GP/PARI.
	Make README, INSTALL a little bit more clear.

2.010006:
	Was looking for Win32 paricfg.h at a wrong (obsolete) location.
	Globbing on Win32 misses gp/gp.c.  Put a workaround.

2.010007:
	Movement of PARI headers (in 2.001804) broke the compile on
	some misconfigured systems, which include
	/usr/include/sys/dl.h, which declares ladd.  Protect by
	temporary redefining ladd (we do not use it from Pari.xs).

	Use extraction of the version suggested by Karim Belabas.

2.010008:
	zcat replaced by gzip -dc, since zcat may not be able to
	handle gz.

2.010100:
	Generate libPARI/paricfg.h ourselves (t/elliptic.t:41 fails
	  unless we unconditionally define NOEXP2).
	Minor updates to INSTALL, change PARI to GP/PARI in messages
	  of Makefile.PL too.
	Wrap the code to get assembler version in alarm().
	More verbose message on reverting to 'port'.

2.010101:
	Improve README and INSTALL.
	Include <time.h> if USE_TIMES (advised by Bernhard Graf <fisch@augensalat.de>).
	Allow more precision loss in ellinit() - the current precision
	is unportable.
	[An attempt to loosen precision requirements break linear.t in
	unrelated places???  See test_eng/Testout.pm.]

2.010102:
	When generating paricfg.h, scan headers for getrusage, ulong,
	  CLK_TCK and ladd (the latter not used yet).
	Do not define ladd, just undef it after PARI headers are included.
	paricfg.h was rebuild too aggressively...
	Exclude gp/gp_init.c from inclusing into libPARI$(LIB_EXT).

2.010103:
	Significant update to documentation in Pari.pm.
	Tone down the warning on error of the pipe from cpp.
	New functions:   lg($x) lgef($x) longword($x, $n) type_name($x)
	t_STR is converted to a string without enclosing "".

2.010200:
	Patch for broken 2.1.2 (gccism).
	Was trying to compile kerneltest.c.
	lgefint($x) added.

2.010201:
	Allow trailing K, M, G in :stack=, :primes= directives of PariInit.pm.
	Recognize that GP/PARI may be in a directory named 'pari' (CVS).

2.010202:
	Would compile whatnow.o.  On the architectures with barely
	working dynalinking (cygwin only?) leads to unresolved symbols.
	Document the possible -fPIC limitation.

2.010300:
	On OS/2 DLOPEN was not supported well enough.
	More verbose messages about generation of paricfg.h.
	Support PARI_DOUBLE_TYPE.
	Support type 'M' of arguments (only numberic arguments, though).

2.010301:
	Better support of GNU as.
	New Makefile.PL options PARIDIR=directory
	Treat underscores in assembler files better.
	Recode brutcopy in terms of gcopy_av (not exported?).
	In 2.2.* branch: plotting and objet:22 tests segfault...
	Create XS functions good for left-right shift (buggy in 2.2.2?).

2.010302:
	Support quick <<, >> with newer PARI (2.2.*).
	Some tests still segfault with newer PARI...

2.010303:
	Set AMSINLINE if needed.
	Put obsolete files and utils in a subdirectory.

2.010304:
	Move a lot of code of Makefile.PL to Math::PariBuild.pm.
	(But DEFINE= processing still extremely messy.)
	New option force_download to Makefile.PL.
	PARIDIR= and MACHINE= were not removed from @ARGV.
	Sanity check: correspondence between numeric and string interfaces.
	Define GCC_INLINE if the compiler is gcc.
	New target `build_tests' for make.

2.010305:
	Misprint in PariBuild.pm fixed (thanks to John Borwick).

2.010400:
	Remove .pod on `make clean'.
	Do part of `perl -V' from Makefile.PL.
	Support 64-bit longsize.
	Fix for broken gcc 2.95 with -ffast-math.
	gpui() (for **) was called with wrong signature...
	0b1011 etc now should work
	$obj->can($meth_name) method implemented (AUTOLOAD-aware).
	Better 'skipped' messages
	Less tests skipped
	  (in graph: plot() - can't redirect output?!)
	  (in objets: error test?!)
	  (in program: f(x)=, print of a matrix, input(), break(),install())
	Support the current implementation of 'M' code.
	[Support for '&' code is still very hard to use - see test engine.]
	Do not define UNIX and USE_TIMES on Win32 (d_times *is* defined?!)
	Support M$ VC and Borland archive-creation switches and VC's
	  object-file destination switch.
	Use documented forcecopy instead of undocumented gcopy_av() [should
	  fix problems with destruction of Mod() too - but slower...].
	Whitespace edits in Perl code.
	Inheriting from Math::Pari lead to recursion in sv2pari().
	  [???  Similar change done to findVariable - not tested]
	Disable assembler on Win32 if not cc == gcc (won't understand GNU
	  assembler anyway).

2.010401:
	Special-case -o for object files for Borland too.
	Inline none/int.h for 2.2.5 or newer too.
	Define SHELL_Q (needed for 2.2.5).
	Adjust svputs to "const" for 2.2.5 or newer.
	Adjust _gtodouble() for 2.2.5 or newer.
	New way of generation of mp.c for 2.2.5 or newer.
	Backslashes in PARIDIR argument could confuse the test engine.
	Support of code 'M' (for mneumonics) was not complete.
	M$ VC can't handle files with .s extension, rename to kernel1.c if needed.
	Enable back default x86 build with Win32 compilers.

2.010402:
	Remove dead code for gcopy_av().
	[Confirmed that it builds on Win32 with M$ VC and mingw for both
	  'none' and 'ix86'.  (One needs to manually edit t/*.t.)  All the
	  hard investigative work was done by Bob "Sisyphus".  Thank him!]
	directory-with-\-support in test engine was flacky.
	CPPMINUS was not used.  Change CPP's %Config from cppstdin to cpp.
	Support for '&' is not very optimized, but works; just omit '&'.

2.010500:
	Cursory support for LIBPARI="-L/lib -lpari"
	 (Problems:
		spoofed version;
		no graphing functions present;
		bad free() at t/Pari.t line 265
			(calling installed Perl function from PARI)
		no PARI tests to convert;
		no POD to create;
		no check for ep codes;
		no patching the source;
	   [All but the first 3 of the problems can be avoided if one
	    lets Makefile.PL download and patch PARI, then builds the library
	    using the downloaded+patched version.]
	 Possible problems:
		different sizeof(long);
		non-compatible threading model;
		-lpari build with different non-compatible compiler;
		...???
	 ).
	Cosmetic changes to TestOut.
	Allow running tests from a different directory (non-Unix filespec?).
	Somehow the patches to 2.1.4 were not applied.  Apply them to 2.1.5 too.
	May download via LWP (thanks to Slaven Rezic).

2.010501:
	Autogenerate valence tables func_codes.h by code_C_translator()
  perl -I utils -MMath::PariBuild -wle "print code_C_translator">func_codes.h
		and use	them from Pari.xs instead of EpVALENCE(ep)
		[which is now used to distinguish user functions only].
			[Workaround for bug in C_constant...  XXXX]
	-DLONG_IS_64BITS is detected in Math::PariBuild and put in paricfg.h.
	Rename t/Pari.t to t/00_Pari.t
	XS((*subaddr)) moved out of function ('dllexport' attribute on cygwin
		is not compatible with static).
	Always define DL_DFLT_NAME as NULL.
	Remove GCC_INLINE if perl is build with -g (needed with 2.1.5 too).
	Misprint in wrongT() [unused function].
	Do not use -O1 for assembler on alpha (not supported any more).
	Document the licence terms.
	Make C code C++-compatible: rename new.
	Do not use undecleared killblock0().
	Support error messages of the form (calling PARI('O(det2($mat))')):
PARI:   ***   obsolete function: O(det2($mat))
                                   ^-----------
	Try to retry with Passive FTP if the default fails (untested).
	Update the list of files to append to libPARI/mp.c up to 2.2.7.
	Compensate to missing bruteall().	XXXX
	Compensate for new "gettime;" idiom in the tests.
	Need to add this on OS/2:
os2$(OBJ_EXT): $(PARI_DIR)/src/systems/os2/os2.c pariinl.h paricfg.h
	$(CCCMD) $(CCCDLFLAGS) $(DEFINE) $(MY_CC_PRE_TARGET)$@ -I $(PARI_DIR)/src/systems/os2 $(PARI_DIR)/src/systems/os2/os2.c
	Support code 'i' (this finishes support for 2.2.7).

2.010600:
	Won't work with 5.8.6 (ok with 5.8.5) [the cryterion of AV being
		empty changed: now it is AvFILLp() == -1; earlier AvFILLp()
		was not checked unless AvALLOC()].
	Document force_download option to Makefile.PL.
	T: make skipped test files emit the reason for skipping.
	Direct overloading of to-number was disabled: '0+' vs '+0'; actually,
		pari2num could not take more than 1 arg, so could not be used
		for overloading...
	passv() was used instead of pasv() in Net::Ftp interface in PariBuild.
	Likewise for <> vs <STDIN>.
	New option pari_tgz=PATH_TO_TAR_GZ to extract a local file and patch
		(if needed) the resulting directory tree.
	Now printing of DESTROY-debugging messages is controlled by macro
		RUN_IF_DEBUG_PARI.  From userland, use PARI_DEBUG(),
		PARI_DEBUG_set(), and environment variable MATHPARI_DEBUG.
	Add -w to test scripts.

2.010601:
	A memory leak on the PARI stack was possible in a rare situaton:
		if a PARI function returning a value which is not on stack
		(very few possibilities: gnil, gun etc.) is called when
		no Math::Pari temporary values are on stack, the GENs
		created for the function arguments would leak.
	Two new contributed debugging functions: dumpStack(), dumpHeap()
		(untested, undocumented).

2.010602:
	A patch to fix a broken 64-bit ploth test of 2.1.6.
	A patch to fix broken hiremainder overflow in port kernel (would not
	   work with -fno-common) of 2.1.6.
	On 64-bit platforms wrong set of tests was chosen, what would
	   result in false positives during tests.
	   Now test errors on 64-bit systems should be considered as
	   indicators of real failures.
	Skip 00_Pari.t:109 on 5.6.0 (bug in REx engine).
	Reasons of most common test errors mentioned in INSTALL.
	Move generation of the flag __HAS_NO_ASM__ to PariBuild.pm;
	   keep ASMINLINE in libPARI/Makefile.PL (since PariBuild.pm
	   knows little about $asmarch), but make it conditional on
	   $do_configure.  (Avoids warnings with Configure.)

2.010603:
	Mismatch between gpmalloc() and free() - possible reason for
		failure of 00_Pari.t:60.
	One branch in installPerlFunctionCV() could allow functions with
		unrecognized prototypes.
	Avoid "signed/unsigned mismatch" warnings in Pari.xs.
	SvPV_nolen() could be used even on older Perls...
	Remove all unused variables from Pari.xs found by M$ compilers and gcc.
	setprimelimit() would not return the old value, but new...
	Some XS functions which took GEN input and non-GEN output did not
		do necessary CLEANUP: ; some other which did not take GEN
		argument would start with oldavma=avma...
	interface5 (unused) would take 5 GENs, when it should have taken 4.
	Update PariBuild's process_sparc() and find_machine_architecture
		to 2.2.8's config/arch-osname.	(XXXX 64-bit disabled on non-alpha?)
	Update to new build method of 2.2.9+.
		XXXX config/Makefile.SH: see makeLVL1.SH logic to support GMP
	Some entry points disappeared in 2.2.*: pariK1, m_evallg, ...
		XXXX gshift3 now gone???
	Implement EXISTS method for Pari (fake) arrays (so one now can view
		PARI arrays in debugger too...
	Extensive update of the test suite to update to new numint/sumint
		flavors and extra spaces in the check-tests files.
	XXXX Temporarily skip nfisincl() - segfaults in 2.2.10...

2.010604:
	Extra include directory to pretend we are in $paridir/OFOO.
	Run funclist build process of GP/PARI...  (Modifies Pari directory...)
	Include forgotten patch for PERL_UNUSED_VAR

2.010700:
	paridir option to Makefile.PL was not documented
	With 2.2.10 (2005/1) intnum tests are WAY off:

	Apparently, patches/diff_2.1.6_no-common is needed with 2.1.7 too.
	sparcv7 build was obsolete.
			=> overflow not defined
	The order of checks in find_machine_architecture() was wrong;
		instead of sparcv9 one would get sparcv7.
	Handling of private SvIOKp() flags was broken (the semantic changed
		long time ago).
	Better assember detection message.
	Advice how to debug problems with `overflow' and `hiremainder'
		not defined.
	Unless MATH_PARI_REPORT_CODES is set and TRUE, do not report ep
		codes mismatches (we do not use them now?).
2.010701:
	An attempt to avoid a memory leak when we are loaded from mod_perl
		(call reset_on_reload(1) to enable.  It kinda works,
		 but confuses perl_debug_mstats() - some memory problem).
	Make memory leak on restart down to about 425K (47577388 after 100).
	Remove the C fix for IOK of sv_true sv_false starting from perl5.6
		(tested with 5.00553 - needed to manually fix .c to avoid
		 a bug in xsubpp).
	Make tests work with 5.00553 too.
	(Finally!) add patch (to 2.1.7) to enable -g.
	Misprint in error message of interface_flexible_int().
	We were redirecting "_lex" as if lexcmp() had interface "lGG".
	loadPari() error message was failing for prototype errors
		in "directly linked" functions.
	Make generated tests start with "55_".
	Remove generated tests on "clean".

2.010702:
	Misprint in testing for 64-bitness would always load test results
		for 32-bit build.
	The patch for -no-common would break "port" build (in some situations?)
		remove from auto-patches, and add the note to INSTALL.
	Patches for -g and restart were omitted.

2.010703:
	Support Yet Another Scheme to Generate headers from function
		descriptors (for 2.2.11)
	Cast off `const' in s_type_name() (XXXX Do older xsubpp support const?)
	Support headers/paripriv.h (if present).

2.010704:
	Make getHeap() use PerlIO, and consistently use bytes for output.
	The patch for -no-common installed on Darwin only.
	Integer conversion was wrong between 2^31 and 2^32;
		tests on 64-bit might provide wrong positives???
		Provided another one if sizeof(long) < sizeof(IV).
	Change all occurences of 2002013 to 2002012
	User contributed: adds hppa support to the linux section of
		PariBuild.pm. Additionally, it adds
		a read flag check to the opening of /proc/cpuinfo, which on

	To pacify a warning, put ((void)0) instead of empty argument to a macro

	in uname: SunOS name 5.9 Generic_118558-26 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
		allow for Generic* to be skipped (if 'sparc' present).
	Update find_machine_architecture() to 2.3.0 logic (so disable sparcv7).
	Append _64 to assembler architecture if needed.
	use strict in Makefile.PL.
	New function inline_headers2() in Math::BuildPari.
	Support 2.3.0 method of building pariinl.h, kernel.o, mpinl.o
		 - only in the case if no MakeLVL1.SH present.
	Link in plotnull.c if plotgnuplot.c is missing.
	Protect numeric constants in intnum too.
	One line in intnum test is wrapped.
	intnum.t would skip allocatemem().
	allocatemem() was not restoring the cached values of avma.

2.010707:
	Allow specification of 2.3.0 via pari_tgz.
	Add version to BuildPari.pm.
	Accomodate Darwin AS which tries to read from STDIN.
	Temporary disable skip if LVL1 is found (in 2.3.0); leads to
		Test returned status 0 (wstat 10, 0xa) on Darwin/port.
	On darwin, diagnoze arch via uname -p.  (SIGBUS during build)

2.010707:
	machine=port builds on 2.3.0 too (same failures).
	-DNO_GRAPHICS_PARI is not enough with 2.3.0; need -DNO_HIGHLEVEL_PARI,
		otherwise segfaults ???
	The branch with UV > ulong had a parens mismatch.

	Allow specification of 2.3.0 via pari_tgz, so manual override
		(for testing purposes only so far!) is easier.
	Add version to BuildPari.pm.
	Accomodate Darwin $AS which tries to read from STDIN.
	Temporary disable skip if LVL1 is found (in 2.3.0); leads to
		Test returned status 0 (wstat 10, 0xa) on Darwin/port.
	On darwin, diagnoze arch via uname -p.  (SIGBUS during build)
	More verbose hints on "Should I auto-download?".
	LWP download code would not binmode()...
	Test OLD subdirectory of GP/PARI ftp directory too.

2.010708:
	Accidentally, a version which would not use Net::FTP was released.
	Print manual download instructions of failure of autofetching too.

2.010709:
	Remove #error on LONG_LARGER_THAN_... (sp?).
	Warn on pitfalls of 2.3.*.
	On Solaris, support MakeLVL0.sh-style build too.

2.010800:
	Test suite was sub()ifying argument to sumnuminit().
	Test suite would not correctly sub()ify intnum() if limits had "()".

	Add warnings to the test suite for detection of #@_

	Attempt to support v5.10 (based on code contributed by Nicholas Clark)


2.010801:
  build_paricfg() takes a version argument
  write_paricfg(): likewise.
  Emit paricfg.h which supports GP/PARI v2.3.4.
  Remove the section on CPAN mirroring from README.
  INSTALL: Explain how to google when server is down.
	Apparently, patch by Nicholas Clark for narg was not mentioned in 
  Skip another subtest in ploth.t.

  Consider `intfuncinit' as requiring "unsane" precision of limits
	(bug in GP/PARI???).  Now all tests pass???

2.010802:
  Confusing variable name in Makefile.PL (===> $perl_int_size).
  AUTOMATED_TESTING taken into account when Makefile.PL asks the operator
  More clear self-documentation of Makefile.PL for manual download.
  Try to un-targz PARI archive also with Archive::Tar (may help with
	smoke testing on MSWin32).
  Convert patches diff_2.1.7_restart diff_2.1.7_-O to Unix line-endings
  multi-arch build; assembler not supported ==> auto machine=port.
  support v5.10 better: now take into account IVsize vs ptrsize
	(fixes "panic: PARI narg value not attached"; assumes int fits in void*
	 without checking XXXX)

2.010803:
  "More clear self-documentation of Makefile.PL for manual download" was busted
  Wrap slow access to stored IV via INT2PTR(), same for quick access.
  Auto-patch 2.1.7 for "Error: suffix or operands invalid for `div'"
  Auto-patch 2.1.6--7 for "kernel1.s:18: Error: alignment not a power of 2"
  Add missing empty lines to patches; clean traces of -p (on Solaris, patch
    is too stupid).
		*_restart fails?
  set DL_DFLT_NAME define in Makefile if option Configure is given.
  Change is_gnu_ass() to not_gnu_ass() in PariBuild.pm; return the
    usage message if present.
  assembler_flags_via(): as assembler_flags() with inverted second arg
	(may be a usage message from assembler);
  (DISABLED: causes segfaults on Solaris): try to guess for -K PIC for ASFLAGS.
  New test 000_load-problem.t reports build parameters (for smoke testing;
	taken from Numeric-Array).

2.010804:
  000_load-problem.t was busted...

2.010805:
  check PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT in addition to AUTOMATED_TESTING.
  report more on environment when user does not answer `y'.
  report the response when listin of remote directory fails.

2.010806:
  Add a few "fake" Makefile macros to simplify remote debugging.
  Get log of command `ftp' if using Perl modules fails
	(if MATHPARI_USEFTP is TRUE, actually use the downloaded file).
  Patch for restart did not have leading "./" - problem with some `patch'es.

2.01080601:
  PariBuild: return results of patching.
  Add a "fake" Makefile macro to report results of patching.
  "Just in case": change the leading component to "." in "diff_2.1.6_no-common".
  New argument to Makefile.PL: version23_ok=NUMBER (default 0).
  Add ftp-cmd to clean Makefile target.

2.0304_001080601:
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080601+
  Add 5.005-new keywords to Makefile.PL.
  Consistently put space after -I in C include paths (needed???).
  Nicer output when debugging faulty LWP and Net::FTP.
  Make test engine look in */32/* directory too on 64-bit builds.
  Remove POD ornaments to make ABSTRACT_FROM work.

2.0304_00108060101
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080601++
  Reword warning about slow intnum: only 75% longer than on PARI/GP.
	(overhead of the internal sub call in subtest 30 looks like 10x
	 overhead of an empty subroutine call).
  New advice that upgrade to 2.3.* may fix `overflow' and `highremainder'.
  Exchange order of initialization of PARI and of `functions_highlevel'
	with >= 2.3.0; allows installation of highlevel functions
	(in particular, install() and PostScript printing).
  New function have_graphics() (not exported).
  The test engine takes into account have_graphics().

2.0304_00108060102
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080602
  If AUTOMATED_TESTING, delete (bogus?) environment variable DISPLAY.
  If AUTOMATED_TESTING, report results of failing tests on STDERR.
  Make test suite report rough run times for successful subtests.

2.0304_001080602
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080603
  Fix misprint and change die() to warn() on failure of $ftp->quit...
  Add some void's in Pari.xs.
  UNDONE (wrong): Protect init_graph() by NO_GRAPHICS_PARI (in restart code);
    include rect.h instead...
  sv2pari(),sv2parimat(): a stupid compiler might guess we don't return value...
  when patching, use && instead of ; in the shell command
  New function Math::PariBuild::patch_args()
  Math::PariBuild::patch_pari() supports option --binary, \ as directory
   separator in command processor.
  Make uname parser recognize i686-pc as ix86.
  Generator of function descriptors could try to regenerate existing file.
  nok_print() in Testout.pm was defined too late.

2.0304_01080603
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080604
  Add (missing in 2.1.*) declaration for pari_init().
  Minor miscount in docs.
  Math::PariBuild: detecting `patch --binary' missed -p1; same for inc_h.diff
  Work around bug in XSUB.h (at least up to 5.11.2) with puts.
  Get GPDATADIR from gp, if present.
  Make self-documentation for switching to 2.3.* more explicit.
  kmx patch for mingw 32-bit Win-build:
	include windows.h (early!) in Pari.xs and highlvl.c
	enable assembler for this build
  x86_64 assembler detection after 2.2.7; thanks to Alexander Haeckel

2.0305_01080604
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.01080604
 Similar (but slightly different) kmx patch to enable 2.3.5 build on mingw.

2.01080605
 p5p in its infinite wisdom removed (automatically generated) defines for PERL_POLLUTE...
	Now every extension needs to add them back by hand...

2.01080606
  GP/PARI in its infinite wisdom changed the structure of download directories.
  When downloading, we were not filtering v2.5 v2.7 etc against which we are not currently able to build.
  Support new format of $^O in Strawberry perl.
  On some installations of cygwin, Perl looks for cygperl5_1\d\.dll for linking.
  On some installations of cygwin, readable files are reported as not readable by stat(); workaround for ./typemap.
  Somehow, uname output on cygwin may have a trailing \cM at the end (stopped detection of assembler).
  Switch from using $Config{cpp} to $Config{cpprun} in libPARI/Makefile.PL [for 2.1.7] (cpp is missing in cygwin);
    - might have been the reason for problems with _overflow and _hiremainder on other platforms too!

2.01080606a
  cygwin's tar generated 0-permissions for the distribution (no auto-workaround...).
  Document workarounds for isprime() with version 2.1.7 (in the BUGS section).

2.01080607
  Correct the documention about fraction of witnesses from >=0.25 to >=0.75.
  Define HAS_STAT and HAS_OPENDIR basing on $Config{i_sysstat} and $Config{i_dirent}.
  Correct spelling errors in POD and comments in Pari.pm (thanks to dsteinbrunner!).
  On AIX, do merge_822 separately in subdirectories (exceeds command line length otherwise).
  On >=2.3.0, reset had-newline-on-output to 1 at startup.  (Saves one spurious NL)
  New patch: diff_2.3.5_stderr_clobber
  New test: 01_no_extra_newlines.t
  Allow download not only via FTP, but also through HTTP.
  In presence of PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING, assume that NO ANSWER on prompt is agreement.
	(It looks like cygwin and MSWin32 automated-testing environment do not have
	 AUTOMATED_TESTING and PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT set...)
  Do not auto-download on 64-bit builds of MSWin32.

2.010807
  Too long version name was a misprint.
  Pay attention to PERL_EXTUTILS_AUTOINSTALL when interpreting empty answers to prompt (probably an overkill).
     (disable this abomination by PERL_MATHPARI_TRUST_MANUAL)
     (to see why this may be needed: http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/a5d65ec6-6bf3-1014-87a8-67ba45601f20)
  Report bytes in the answer for prompt.
  Separate into separate subroutines inspecting versions available for download from the actual download.
  Change the logic of fallback Net::FTP --> LWP: before, if Net::FTP fails in retrieving the directory listing;
    now: if this happens, or if it fails to retrieve the file (how can it happen?! see http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/e7f9d5a7-6bfa-1014-9d0f-1948c9c86cae)
  __wrap_PARI_macro:	new function (not exported)
  parse_as_gp:		new function (exported by default)
  More verbose error message for "Cannot load a Pari macro".

2.010808
  A night of sleep fixed problems of parse_of_gp with the operator \ and empty lines.
     (test suite updated)
  Actually, mingw was not ready for HAVE_OPENDIR.
  Store which patches were applied in $dir/.perl.patches.
  Report which patches were not applied.
  Export patches_for() from BuildPari.
  pari_tgz build option was broken (by LWP-after-NFTP support code — which, apparently, did not help with timeouts).
  Ignore 0-size "downloaded" files.


2.010809
  MakeMaker of 5.22 (and, maybe, 5.20) started to call test_dynamic target in the daughter Makefile.
  Correct "{" in RExes of libPARI/gphelp.
  Attempt to workaround a broken config of gcc on vendor's Perl on Solaris.

2.01080900
  Repackage as zip

2.010810
  Now can auto-patch an already present pari src directory.  Controlled by the new options force_patch or force_patch=NUM (default is 1).
     Default: do if it is our subdirectory.
  Fix patch/diff_2.3.5_mingw-w64.
  Take into account a changed name for the download directory for GP/PARI src.
  A workaround for broken <<do FILE>> behaviour in newer Perls (in ./test_eng/ex.t).
  Include -I. when we run $^X on GP/PARI's scripts (now . is disabled on newer Perls) during Math::Pari build.
	(Analysis by Kent Fredric, ticket 120711.)
  Users could have sneaked in a later version than 2.3.5.  Detect this and warn.
  Makefile.PL was not using strict.
  Allow -DUSE_STANDALONE_PARILIB to make Pari.xs use only public interfaces of GP/PARI.
  Incorporate certain changes to simplify building with a standalone PARI library:
	-KPIC per http://gnats.netbsd.org/45271 (but it is not changed to -fPIC already???)
  New unsupported function pari_formatted_version_from_includes($includeDir) from public headers.
  Change name of option parilib to parilibs.
  With -DNO_GNUPLOT_PARI, has a chance to compile with native graphics enabled (not tested).
	(Temporarily?) disable ploth() testing when this is defined.
  The code to filter out too new versions of Pari directories was reacting on non-directories too.
  Allow building if the plotting functionality removed in v2.2.13 is restored (not tested).
  Include patches diff_add_gnuplotNeeded diff_add_gnuplotAdd restoring this remove functionality (and diff_add_gnuplotAll for completeness).
  Auto-apply these patches starting with 2.2.13.
  Update build time messages to reflect the status of plotting.

2.0305_010810
  Change the default for $ok23 to 1.

2.0305_010811
  memUsage() had wrong count in EXTEND(sp...) (compatible with very old perls???)

2.030500
  Since it looks like we do not auto-generate highlvl.h, add a patch for it too.
  New function plot_outfile_set().
  Deprecate set_plot_fh() with Term::Gnuplot version 0.55 and later.
  Fix documentation accordingly.

2.030501
XXX  The report of missing patches is very wrong (false negative and positives) when reusing a patched directory.
  Do not call pari_init_defaults() if we use INIT_DFTm.
  Call pari_close_opts() on restart (after 2.2.12).
XXX  Still fails to restart: perl -Mblib -wle "for (1..shift) {delete $INC{q(Math/Pari.pm)}; require Math::Pari; print sin Math::Pari::PARI(1)}" 2
XXX  Crashes in Math::Pari::DESTROY  Cmp with: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-dev-0511/msg00037.html
  Do not try gnuplot with versions after 2.3.*.
  $ok32 was not updated!!!
  Add macros needed for 2.5.0 to our paricfg.h.
XXX  We did not put the name for level1 kernel there yet...
  New files libPARI/pre-noinline.h libPARI/post-noinline.h (to generate level0 kernel).
  New code to generate level0 and level1 kernels above 2.3.*.  (We did not reuse the code to generate pariinl.h.)  (libPARI.a is OK with 2.5.0)
XXX    only none for level1 now.
  ordnum[] became id() in 2.4.0.
  Set cb_pari_pre_recover after 2.4.0 (when did it appear???).
  Correct for one less entry in PariOut after 2.4.0 (likewise???).
  Our macroized free() cannot take (const *); insert conversion to (void *) in a couple of places (for ep's).
  We had our own function allocatemem(); rename.
  fill_argvect() and loadPari() need: a const* argument and variables for ep->code.
  autoloadPerlFunction() requires a const* argument.
XXX  Preliminary: how to check that ep is a PARI function, and get its address.
XXX  On the first extract of Makefile.PL, 822 fails?!  Second run of Makefile.PL succeeds (2.5.0).
	Maybe it generates empty files which stop a rerun???
  On MSWin32, look in systems/mingw for C files.
  bruteall() disappears (again!) in 2.5.0.
  let pprint() be the same as print() on 2.5.0 (as in GP/PARI).
  use init_stack() or pari_init_stack() instead of allocatemoremem().
  What happens with *workSV when we reassign it???!!!   LEAK!!!		[Actually: no!]
XXX  for t_CLOSURE, aid0() checks typ(gelt(,6)) == t_VEC.
XXX  Temporarily (???) in pariVar and findVariable, prohibit variables holding closures.
[X]  Mapping from section names to numbers changed!!!  (Need to recheck with every version???  Definitely changed in 2.10...)
  Added a test for internal (non-exportable) Pari "function names" (such as "_!").  (Need to recheck with every version???)
		A few tests started to pass with 2.5.0 on Windows: Failed 16/82 test programs. 18/356 subtests failed.
XXX  t_FFELT, t_CLOSURE
XXX  2.10.0: t_ERROR t_INFINITY. 2 t_LIST is actually in 2.1.7, but we treated it as a black box.  Should we continue this???
XXX  New type 'J' (at least in 2.10.0???).
XXX  DEBUGMEM DEBUGLEVEL (at least in 2.10.0???)

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX On NetBSD: es.c:312:13: error: 'input_method' has no member named '__fgets_chk'
	(Somebody redefined `fgets' between paripriv.h and line 312 of es.c.  But there is no `#include's there???
	(Only fgets() is redefined, not fgets.  Due to -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2.)

2.030502
  New function code_C_comment_interface() in Math::PariBuild:
    perl -I utils -MMath::PariBuild -w00pe "Math::PariBuild::code_C_comment_interface" Pari.xs >Pari.xs-n
  Add the corresponding string codes to text of interfaceDDD() XSUBs (to those who have associated string codes).
    (as above, and then manually for 9900).
  New XSUB added_sections() (essentially, to remind that sections change time to time).
XXX  Handle added_sections() in Math::Pari (stub only! XXXX).
XXX  (Temporarily???) Remove -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (on NetBSD breaks input_method->fgets() in es.c).

2.030503
XXX  (Temporarily) add new GEN code_return_1 which is a closure returning 1.
XXX  (Temporarily) use code_return_1 as an argument to all PARI functions taking a t_CLOSURE (in fill_argvect() and T_PariExpr)
XXX  Are DE, DI supported types in PARI/GP???
XXX  disttest does something like -I ../../pari-2.3.5 ...... -I ./pari-2.5.0  (due to PASSTHRU ???) - won't hurt anyway!
XXX  new Prototype-prefix letter 'm' for return type of no-copy???
XXX  The prototype letter 'V' _stores_ the variable numbers, and not passes them as arguments.
        So translates (X=A,B,sin(X)) to (A,B, X -> sin(X)).
XXX  No access to low-level iterators (as in forvec_init()).
XXX  Can we use closure_func_err() in our error handler?  (Also: it may be used in a warning handler???)
XXX (Temporarily) ignore the variables of type `V' in prebuilt interfaces: remove them from the arglist of the called C function.
		Failed 16/82 test programs. 67/595 subtests failed.
XXX (Temporarily) same for flexible interfaces.
		Failed 16/82 test programs. 102/647 subtests failed.	(6 crashes)
  Handling of Prototype code 'x' in GP/PARI was missing.	Failed 16/82 test programs. 120/678 subtests failed (7 crashes).
XXX  Code to generate closure out of external function (genclosure() with is_external) may be completely bogus.
  ForeignFuncFree may have caused double free()s.
  Adding/free()ing ->help for our installed subroutines was completely busted.
  Re-installing in GP/PARI was ignoring the foreignFuncFree handler.
  Remove pre-junk in precode.  (Is not used for a long time.)
	Failed 16/82 test programs. 104/650 subtests failed.
  The code to handle more than 1 optional argument was completely busted.
XXX  Test for this???
	Failed 16/82 test programs. 122/681 subtests failed.

  We did not detach_stack() on restart.  Now grows 6.7M on 1e5 iterations with 2.3.5 32bit windows (takes about 15min):
    perl -Mblib -le "for (1..shift) {delete $INC{q(Math/Pari.pm)}; require Math::Pari; print sin Math::Pari::PARI(1)} END{warn 1; sleep 500}" 100000
XXX  Probably worksv and workErrsv leaking???
XXX  But this crashes with 100 (but not with 20):

  To avoid warnings on redefinition, avoid function names in the script being resolved at compile time:
	perl -Mblib -wle "for (1..shift) {delete $INC{q(Math/Pari.pm)}; %Math::Pari::=(); delete $::{PARI}; require Math::Pari; $n=q(Math::Pari::PARI); $N=q(PARI); *$N = \&$n; print sin &$N(1)}" 1000
		but this cannot survive more than a few dozens of iterations...  But this runs fine:
	perl -wle "for (1..shift) {delete $INC{q(List/Util.pm)}; %List::Util:: = %Scalar::Util:: = %Sub::Util:: = (); $N=q(sum0); $n=qq(List::Util::$N); delete $::{$N}; require List::Util; *$N = \&$n; print 1 + &$N(1..10)}" 20000
  The fix for -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE was not working.  Redo.

  Patch for 2.5.0 was not updated.  (Still not auto-applied.)
  PerlFunctionArg1 had an extra *.
  New XSUB __detach_stack().

2.030505
XXX  Adding __detach_stack() on line 146 (but not on 143) fixes a crash in 00_Pari.t.  So does making $fff lexical!!!
	Skipping 2 tests after assignment to $fff does not help!
  On NetBSD, still too many warnings for CPANtesters infrastructure to work.  Disable -Wextra as well.
  Do not disable -Wall unless AUTOMATED_TESTING.
XXX  Code, but not enable (yet?) disabling -Wdiscarded-qualifiers too.
  Find a "supported" Pari directory even if "unsupported" ones are present earlier in the list of directories to search.
  Make exception for '.': if any Pari subdirectory is found, it is going to be used.
    (Now one can work with a "newer" paridir in a current directory, but `make disttest' would pick up a supported directory in ..)

2.030506
  For Pari.xs, redefine away strtoi to avoid a conflicting declaration on NetBSD included via perl.h.
  Define PTRV (if needed) and include casts to PTRV when using INT2PTR (otherwise may fail on NetBSD).
	How comes that obsolete versions of INT2PTR survived there???

2.030507
  Make inclusion of none/gcdext.c conditional on its existence, not on version.

	gnukfreebsd(lddl) cygwin strawberry openbsd netbsd linux(lddl)
  New file gdbinit-my (quasi-documentation inside it).
  Avoid a leak with workErrsv, make worksv optimized.
  New macro renewWorkSv to reuse when the old value was already REFCNT_dec'ed.
	Leak on restart disappears: after about 6min of running, the working space stabilizes on the level (Start=5M)+(256K).
  Make t/00_Pari.t set PARI_DEBUG if MATHPARI_T_DEBUG is in environment.
  Compensate for: In >= 2.5.0 the definition of taille() and taille2() are mixed up.
			Down to 5 crashes (from 8).
  dumpStack() renamed to __dumpStack().
     XXXX should not be used at all: it assumes the entry point to “the region on stack” is at its smallest address.
  New function dumpStack() for dumping our values on stack.
		XXXX evalstate_reset() resets avma!!!  Need to grab cb_pari_handle_exception().
			(Need also to find avma for every eval{} level — and for eval ''... ???  What about globally visible SVs???)
  In cb_pari_handle_exception(), do not let evalstate_reset() reset avma!
			Down to 3 crashes.
XXX allocatemem() should check whether it is called from inside a PARI function.
  Avoid extra copying of strings in the interface creation.
  We were not ignoring the Perl argument for 'V' in the flexible interfaces.
			Down to 1 crash.
  Initialize pari_colormap (to a saner value than GP), pari_graphcolors.
			No crashes in the part of the test suite we can parse!

2.030508
  New patch diff-2.5.0-exceptions for exception handling.
	=> Failed 16/82 test programs. 151/1304 subtests failed.  (But still crashes without -g...)
  Support this model of exception handling in _Sverrdie(), math_pari_handle_exception() and init code.
  Align also the new 3-line format of error messages; remove trailing '\n' and '.' if present.
  Auto-patch on v2.5.* (unsupported!!! only partially working on 2.5.0).
  README was missing the copyright section.
  Auto-patching was not working with `pari_tgz'.
  Allow version-spec in the table of patches to contain trailing *.
  Patch all sub-versions of 2.3.* the same as 2.3.5 (untested).
  Error in build of pari.desc was not detected on Windows.
  Extra arguments added to build_funclist() etc. (used during build).
  pari.desc needs to be built differently on 2.5.0.
  The script gen_members is not used for build on 2.5.0.
  More clear message about “failed patches (if any)” put into .perl.patches.
   => 55_linear.t crashes in vecsort([[1,8,5],[2,5,8],[3,6,-6],[4,8,6]],2); Failed 16/82 test programs. 150/1300 subtests failed.

  XXX bibli2.o requires -Og (segfaults with -O) on mingw gcc 4.9.2.  (Does not set content of v in vecsort0().)

  XXX		PARI lexical variables are not visible from Perl code (even if it is embedded).  So when we convert Perl
		subroutine to an inline closure, we need only the explicit loop variables (of the smallest enclosing scope?)
			With one (the only present, except matrix()!), the code is (e.g., for sin(x) in void context)
				OCpushlex(-1) OCPrecreal OCcallgen2(ep) OCpop(1).
			Only matrix() takes two V’s.  A few take VE etc (without “=”)
		Currently: the loop variables are globals.

  XXX	Should not we work around Mac being broken: see end of https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127028 ???

2.030509
  Document better that unsupported versions of GP/PARI should be in a subdirectory (for auto-search to not reject them).
  Allow an expanded "version" in patches_for() (during build) (now can find which patches to recommend).
  New patch to allow tuning optimization of particular functions (includes vecsort0() now).
	XXX  But see https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FAQ#optimize_attribute_broken
  Set aOPT__vectsort0 to -Og on gcc 4.9.*.
	XXX  But this makes it harder to switch optimization options on the command line.
  Better warning on already applied patches (still, we do not parse .perl.patches, just check for its existence).
  Test for -g on Makefile.PL command line would not detect "OPTIMIZE=-Og -g".
  For initialization of colors, we were using gcopy() instead of gclone()!!!
  Redo the “exceptions” patch for 2.5.5.
	=> Failed 16/90 test programs. 150/1307 subtests failed.
  Put license into META fails.
	  XXX  Doing via LICENSE fails.  (Bug in MakeMaker???  Due to 2 Makefile.PLs?)
  Add “package” declaration to Math::PariInit (for MetaCPAN to recognize the POD).
  Add setprimelimit() and allocatemem() to Math::PariInit docs.
  Add extra arguments $quote, $echo, $res to parse_as_gp to return the parsed values/echo/print res.
  Parse \q, \p (and allow \e) in parse_as_gp;
  Better handling of {}-quoting in parse_as_gp.
  XXX  We do not allow allocatemem() in argument to PARI()???  It would longjmp(), and we do not catch it???

  For 2.7.0, build mt subsystem.

  Update Pari.xs to new macros (and code) in 2.7.0.
