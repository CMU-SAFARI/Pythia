<!-- ## Update
### Aug 13th, 2021
It has been brought to our attention that the Ligra and PARSEC-2.1 traces required to evaluate the artifact are not correctly getting downloaded using the `download_traces.pl` script. For now, we ask the reader to download **all** Ligra and PARSEC-2.1 traces (~10 GB) by (1) clicking on the mega link (see [Section 5](https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Pythia#more-traces)), and (2) clicking on "Download as ZIP" option. We are working with megatools developer to resolve the issue soon.  -->

## What is Pythia?

> Pythia is a hardware-realizable, light-weight data prefetcher that uses reinforcement learning to generate accurate, timely, and system-aware prefetch requests. 

Pythia formulates hardware prefetching as a reinforcement learning task. For every demand request, Pythia observes multiple different types of program context information to take a prefetch decision. For every prefetch decision, Pythia receives a numerical reward that evaluates prefetch quality under the current memory bandwidth utilization. Pythia uses this reward to reinforce the correlation between program context information and prefetch decision to generate highly accurate, timely, and system-aware prefetch requests in the future.

Pythia is presetend at MICRO 2021.

## About The Framework

Pythia is implemented in [ChampSim simulator](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim). We have significantly modified the prefetcher integration pipeline in ChampSim to add support to a wide range of prior prefetching proposals mentioned below:

* Stride [Fu+, MICRO'92]
* Streamer [Chen and Baer, IEEE TC'95]
* SMS [Somogyi+, ISCA'06]
* AMPM [Ishii+, ICS'09]
* Sandbox [Pugsley+, HPCA'14]
* BOP [Michaud, HPCA'16]
* SPP [Kim+, MICRO'16]
* Bingo [Bakshalipour+, HPCA'19]
* SPP+PPF [Bhatia+, ISCA'19]
* DSPatch [Bera+, MICRO'19]
* MLOP [Shakerinava+, DPC-3'19]
* IPCP [Pakalapati+, ISCA'20]

Most of the  prefetchers (e.g., SPP [1], Bingo [2], IPCP [3]) reuse codes from [2nd]() and [3rd]() data prefetching championships (DPC). Others (e.g., AMPM [4], SMS [5]) are implemented from scratch and shows similar relative performance reported by previous works.

## Prerequisites

The infrastructure has been tested with the following system configuration:
  * G++ v6.3.0 20170516
  * CMake v3.20.2
  * md5sum v8.26
  * Perl v5.24.1
  * [Megatools 1.11.0](https://megatools.megous.com) (Note that v1.9.98 does **NOT** work)

## Installation

0. Install necessary prequisites
    ```bash
    sudo apt install perl
    ```
1. Clone the GitHub repo
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Pythia.git
   ```
2. Clone the bloomfilter library inside Pythia home directory
   
   ```bash
   cd Pythia
   git clone https://github.com/mavam/libbf.git libbf
   ```
3. Build bloomfilter library. This should create the static `libbf.a` library inside `build` directory
   
    ```bash
    cd libbf
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ../
    make clean && make
    ```
4. Build Pythia for single/multi core using build script. This should create the executable inside `bin` directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd $PYTHIA_HOME
   # ./build_champsim.sh <l1_pref> <l2_pref> <llc_pref> <ncores>
   ./build_champsim.sh multi multi no 1
   ```
   Please use `build_champsim_highcore.sh` to build ChampSim for more than four cores.

5. _Set appropriate environment variables as follows:_

    ```bash
    source setvars.sh
    ```

## Preparing Traces
0. Install the megatools executable

    ```bash
    cd $PYTHIA_HOME/scripts
    wget https://megatools.megous.com/builds/builds/megatools-1.11.1.20230212-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    tar -xvf megatools-1.11.1.20230212-linux-x86_64.tar.gz 
    ```
> Note: The megatools link might change in the future depending on latest release. Please recheck the link if the download fails.

1. Use the `download_traces.pl` perl script to download necessary ChampSim traces used in our paper.

    ```bash
    mkdir $PYTHIA_HOME/traces/
    cd $PYTHIA_HOME/scripts/
    perl download_traces.pl --csv artifact_traces.csv --dir ../traces/
    ```
> Note: The script should download **233** traces. Please check the final log for any incomplete downloads. The total size of all traces would be **~52 GB**.

2. Once the trace download completes, please verify the checksum as follows. _Please make sure all traces pass the checksum test._

    ```bash
    cd $PYTHIA_HOME/traces
    md5sum -c ../scripts/artifact_traces.md5
    ```

3. If the traces are downloaded in some other path, please change the full path in `experiments/MICRO21_1C.tlist` and `experiments/MICRO21_4C.tlist` accordingly.

### More Traces
1. We are also releasing a new set of ChampSim traces from [PARSEC 2.1](https://parsec.cs.princeton.edu) and [Ligra](https://github.com/jshun/ligra). The trace drop-points are measured using [Intel Pinplay](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/program-recordreplay-toolkit.html) and the traces are captured by the ChampSim PIN tool. The traces can be found in the following links. To download these traces in bulk, please use the "Download as ZIP" option from mega.io web-interface.
      * PARSEC-2.1: https://bit.ly/champsim-parsec2
      * Ligra: https://bit.ly/champsim-ligra
   
2. Our simulation infrastructure is completely compatible with all prior ChampSim traces used in CRC-2 and DPC-3. One can also convert the CVP-2 traces (courtesy of Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies) to ChampSim format using [the following converter](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim/tree/master/cvp_tracer). The traces can be found in the follwing websites:
     * CRC-2 traces: http://bit.ly/2t2nkUj
     * DPC-3 traces: http://hpca23.cse.tamu.edu/champsim-traces/speccpu/
     * CVP-2 traces: https://www.microarch.org/cvp1/cvp2/rules.html

## Experimental Workflow
Our experimental workflow consists of two stages: (1) launching experiments, and (2) rolling up statistics from experiment outputs.

### Launching Experiments
1. To create necessary experiment commands in bulk, we will use `scripts/create_jobfile.pl`
2. `create_jobfile.pl` requires three necessary arguments:
      * `exe`: the full path of the executable to run
      * `tlist`: contains trace definitions
      * `exp`: contains knobs of the experiements to run
3. Create experiments as follows. _Please make sure the paths used in tlist and exp files are appropriate_.
   
      ```bash
      cd $PYTHIA_HOME/experiments/
      perl ../scripts/create_jobfile.pl --exe $PYTHIA_HOME/bin/perceptron-multi-multi-no-ship-1core --tlist MICRO21_1C.tlist --exp MICRO21_1C.exp --local 1 > jobfile.sh
      ```

4. Go to a run directory (or create one) inside `experiements` to launch runs in the following way:
      ```bash
      cd experiments_1C
      source ../jobfile.sh
      ```

5. If you have [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) support to launch multiple jobs in a compute cluster, please provide `--local 0` to `create_jobfile.pl`

### Rolling-up Statistics
1. To rollup stats in bulk, we will use `scripts/rollup.pl`
2. `rollup.pl` requires three necessary arguments:
      * `tlist`
      * `exp`
      * `mfile`: specifies stat names and reduction method to rollup
3. Rollup statistics as follows. _Please make sure the paths used in tlist and exp files are appropriate_.
   
      ```bash
      cd experiements_1C/
      perl ../../scripts/rollup.pl --tlist ../MICRO21_1C.tlist --exp ../MICRO21_1C.exp --mfile ../rollup_1C_base_config.mfile > rollup.csv
      ```

4. Export the `rollup.csv` file in you favourite data processor (Python Pandas, Excel, Numbers, etc.) to gain insights.

## HDL Implementation
We also implement Pythia in [Chisel HDL](https://www.chisel-lang.org) to faithfully measure the area and power cost. The implementation, along with the reports from umcL65 library, can be found the following GitHub repo. Please note that the area and power projections in the sample report is different than what is reported in the paper due to different technology.

## Code Walkthrough
> Pythia was code-named Scooby (the mistery-solving dog) during the developement. So any mention of Scooby anywhere in the code inadvertently means Pythia.

* The top-level files for Pythia are `prefetchers/scooby.cc` and `inc/scooby.h`. These two files declare and define the high-level functions for Pythia (e.g., `invoke_prefetcher`, `register_fill`, etc.). 
* The released version of Pythia has two types of RL engine defined: _basic_ and _featurewise_. They differ only in terms of the QVStore organization (please refer to our [paper](arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12021.pdf) to know more about QVStore). The QVStore for _basic_ version is simply defined as a two-dimensional table, whereas the _featurewise_ version defines it as a hierarchichal organization of multiple small tables. The implementation of respective engines can be found in `src/` and `inc/` directories.
* `inc/feature_knowledge.h` and `src/feature_knowldege.cc` define how to compute each program feature from the raw attributes of a deamand request. If you want to define your own feature, extend the enum `FeatureType` in `inc/feature_knowledge.h` and define its corresponding `process` function.
* `inc/util.h` and `src/util.cc` contain all hashing functions used in our evaluation. Play around with them, as a better hash function can also provide performance benefits.
